# Alzheimer's Diseases Detection Using ML
The study investigates the application of advanced machine learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. AD is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide, particularly the elderly population. The.
By using CNNs and RNNs, which are known for analyzing spatial and sequential data respectively, the research aims are to gain a deeper understanding of the progression of Alzheimer Disease. RNNs are particularly useful in tracking changes over time, while CNNs is used in identifying patterns in brain scans, such as MRI images, which play a crucial role in AD research.
The study utilizes widely available datasets from reputable sources like OASIS and Kaggle, which are known for their collection of publicly available brain imaging data. The results demonstrate promising performance, with CNNs achieving an accuracy rate of 100% on the OASIS dataset and 97.33% on Kaggle. Similarly, RNNs achieve accuracy rates of 73.15% and 80.67% on the same datasets.
These findings show the potential of machine learning in detection of Alzheimer Disease, as well as enhancing the process of its diagnosis and treatment of the disease. They show the significance of using diverse datasets and Machine Learnings techniques to tackle the problems associated with AD research and to develop effective solution for this complex condition.
